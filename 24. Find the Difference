Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
  Input:
  s = "abcd"
  t = "abcde"
  Output:
  e
  Explanation:
  'e' is the letter that was added.
  
XOR approach:
  We simply xor the the characters of two strings.
  After this xor the repeating characters will become zero and our answer will be equal to the unique character.


class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char c = 0;
        for(char cs: s) c ^= cs;
        for(char ct: t) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
};
